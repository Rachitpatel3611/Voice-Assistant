# Voice Assistant
 A Voice Assistant Project is a software system designed to interact with users through spoken commands, providing an automated way to perform tasks, answer questions, and manage daily activities using voice recognition technology. These projects often involve integrating several technologies, including speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and text-to-speech (TTS) systems.
